Rigging and animation tools for Maya

Currently only works with PySide, aka Maya 2016 and earlier (hopefully 2017+ will be supported very soon)

## Installation
Download, unzip and put the "motiga" folder in one of your Maya script folders.

## Usage
In the script editor, in a Python tab, run:

```python
import motiga.tool.fossil.main
motiga.tool.fossil.main.RigTool()
```

More instructions pending.
